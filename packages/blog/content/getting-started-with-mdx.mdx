# Getting Started with MDX

MDX is a powerful format that lets you use JSX in your Markdown content. This means you can seamlessly blend static content with interactive React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to write JSX embedded inside Markdown. It's perfect for technical documentation, blog posts, and any content where you might want to include interactive examples or custom styling.

## Basic Syntax

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Inline code`
- [Links](https://example.com)

### Code Blocks

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Interactive Components

The real power of MDX comes from being able to embed React components directly in your content. For example, you could include:

- Interactive code examples
- Custom callout boxes
- Data visualizations
- Form components

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it simple**: Don't overuse interactive components
2. **Accessibility first**: Ensure all components are accessible
3. **Performance**: Be mindful of bundle size when adding components
4. **Consistency**: Use a consistent design system

MDX opens up endless possibilities for rich, interactive content while maintaining the simplicity of Markdown for everyday writing.
