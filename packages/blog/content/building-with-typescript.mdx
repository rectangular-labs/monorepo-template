# Building with TypeScript

TypeScript has become an essential tool for building robust, maintainable JavaScript applications. Here's our approach to leveraging TypeScript effectively.

## Type Safety First

The primary benefit of TypeScript is catching errors at compile time rather than runtime. We embrace strict type checking:

```typescript
// Configure strict settings in tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  }
}
```

## Schema Validation with ArkType

For runtime validation, we use ArkType instead of Zod. ArkType provides excellent TypeScript integration:

```typescript
import { type } from "arktype";

const UserSchema = type({
  id: "number",
  name: "string",
  email: "string",
  "age?": "number"
});

// Type is automatically inferred
type User = typeof UserSchema.infer;
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Favor Composition Over Inheritance

```typescript
type BaseEntity = {
  id: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
};

type User = BaseEntity & {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```

### 2. Use Union Types Instead of Enums

```typescript
// Prefer this
type Status = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";

// Over this
enum Status {
  Pending = "pending",
  Approved = "approved", 
  Rejected = "rejected"
}
```

### 3. Leverage Template Literal Types

```typescript
type EventName = `on${Capitalize<string>}`;
type Color = `#${string}`;
```

## Tooling Setup

Our TypeScript setup includes:

- **Strict compilation** for maximum type safety
- **Path mapping** for clean imports
- **Incremental builds** for performance
- **Declaration maps** for better debugging

TypeScript isn't just about typesâ€”it's about building confidence in your code through better tooling and developer experience.
